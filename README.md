About This Project
This is a personal playground for exploring neural networks and applying techniques I learned at university. 
I'm building the nodes from scratch, focusing on the underlying mathematics and algorithms to gain a deeper understanding, rather than relying on libraries without truly grasping how they work.

Goals:
Learn how it really works
Stop feeling like just using scripts without understanding them
